Installing g++ to mark programming assignments

-Follow these steps to install g++ (the GNU C++ compiler) for Windows. 
-Pick the drive and a folder in which you want to install g++. I'll assume that it is C:, but you can choose a different one. If you choose a different drive or a different folder, you'll need to adapt the directions below accordingly.
-Download full.exe, an about 14 megabyte executable, to C:\full.exe. Be sure the browser saves the file as C:\full.exe.

-http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/pages/faculty/alee/g++/full.exe

-Run the downloaded executable. This will install g++ on your hard drive. Go to the C: drive using Windows Explorer and double-click on full.exe. Or, open a DOS window (Start > Programs > Command Prompt), connect to the C: drive using the cd command, and type full.
-Locate where the bin folder was created for the g++ installation. On my Windows XP machine, it was created in the following path:
-C:\cygnus\cygwin-b20\H-i586-cygwin32\bin
-You now should add it to the PATH environment variable. You do that by following: Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
-At this point you can see the PATH variable either in the User Variables or in the System Variables. Add the g++ path into the PATH variable. You add it to the end of the existing value separated by a semicolon (';'). 
-Restart your computer
